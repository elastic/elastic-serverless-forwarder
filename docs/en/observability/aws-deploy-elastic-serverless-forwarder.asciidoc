:description: Deploy the Elastic Serverless Forwarder using Kibana and the AWS Serverless Application Repository (SAR).

To deploy Elastic Serverless Forwarder, you have to:

* <<aws-serverless-forwarder-deploy-kibana>>
* <<sample-s3-config-file>>
* <<aws-serverless-forwarder-define-deploy-parameters>>
* <<aws-serverless-forwarder-deploy-sar>>

NOTE: This page describes the basic steps required to deploy Elastic Serverless
Forwarder for {aws}— for additional information on configuration topics such as permissions and automatic routing, and parsing and enriching data, see <<aws-elastic-serverless-forwarder-configuration>>.

[[aws-serverless-forwarder-deploy-prereq]]
=== Pre-requisites
This documentation assumes you have some familiarity with {aws} services and you have correctly created and configured the necessary {aws} objects. For example, if you want to use an Amazon S3 (via SQS event notifications) input then you must ensure that you have enabled AWS VPC flow logs to be sent to that bucket, and created an SQS queue to receive those logs. For more information, refer to the relevant https://docs.aws.amazon.com/[{aws} docs].

// Need more details on pre-reqs for other input types

[[aws-serverless-forwarder-deploy-kibana]]
== Install {aws} integration assets in {kib}

. Go to **Integrations** in {kib} and search for {aws} (or select the **{aws}**
  category to filter the list).
. Click the {aws} integration, select **Settings** and click
**Install {aws} assets** and confirm to install all the {aws} integration assets.

[role="screenshot"]
image::images/aws-serverless-forwarder-install-assets.png[Find and install AWS integration assets in {kib}]

Adding integrations from {kib} provides appropriate pre-built dashboards,
ingest node configurations, and other assets that help you get the most out of
the data you ingest. The integrations use https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/data-streams.html[data streams]
with specific https://www.elastic.co/blog/an-introduction-to-the-elastic-data-stream-naming-scheme[naming conventions]
that provide you with more granular controls and flexibility on managing data ingestion.

NOTE: We recommend using integration assets to get started but the forwarder supports writing to any index, alias, or custom data stream. This enables existing Elasticsearch users to re-use index templates, ingest pipelines, or dashboards that are already created and connected to existing processes or systems. If you already have an existing index or data stream you to send data to then then you can skip this deployment step.

[[sample-s3-config-file]]
== Create and upload `config.yaml` to S3 bucket

Elastic Serverless Forwarder requires a `config.yaml` file to be uploaded to an S3 bucket and referenced by the `S3_CONFIG_FILE` environment variable.

Save the following YAML content as `config.yaml` and edit as required before uploading to an S3 bucket. You should remove any inputs or arguments you are not using, and ensure you have entered the correct URLs and credentials as per the inline comments.

[[s3-config-file-fields]]
=== Fields

//convert to description list?

`inputs.[]`:

A list of inputs (i.e. triggers) for the Elastic Serverless Forwarder Lambda function.

`inputs.[].type`:

The type of trigger input (`cloudwatch-logs`, `kinesis-data-stream`, `sqs` and `s3-sqs` are currently supported).

`inputs.[].id`:

The ARN of the trigger input according to the type. Multiple input entries can have different unique ids with the same type.
Inputs of type `cloudwatch-logs` accept both CloudWatch Logs Log Group and CloudWatch Logs Log Stream ARNs.

`inputs.[].outputs`:

A list of outputs (i.e. forwarding targets) for the Elastic Serverless Forwarder Lambda function. You can have multiple outputs for an input, but only one output can be defined per type.

`inputs.[].outputs.[].type`:

The type of the forwarding target output (currently only `elasticsearch` supported).

`inputs.[].outputs.[].args`:
Custom init arguments for the specified forwarding target output.

For `elasticsearch` the following arguments are supported:

  * `args.elasticsearch_url`: URL of elasticsearch endpoint in the format `http(s)://domain.tld:port`. Mandatory when `args.cloud_id` is not provided. Will take precedence over `args.cloud_id` if both are defined.
  * `args.cloud_id`: Cloud ID of elasticsearch endpoint. Mandatory when `args.elasticsearch_url` is not provided. Will be ignored if `args.elasticsearch_url` is defined.
  * `args.username`: Username of the elasticsearch instance to connect to. Mandatory when `args.api_key` is not provided. Will take precedence over `args.api_key` if both are defined.
  * `args.password` Password of the elasticsearch instance to connect to. Mandatory when `args.api_key` is not provided. Will take precedence over `args.api_key` if both are defined.
  * `args.api_key`:  API key of elasticsearch endpoint in the format **base64encode(api_key_id:api_key_secret)**. Mandatory when `args.username`  and `args.password` are not provided. Will be ignored if `args.username`/`args.password` are defined.
  * `args.es_datastream_name`: Name of data stream or index where logs should be forwarded to. Lambda supports automatic routing of various {aws} service logs to the corresponding data streams for further processing and storage in the {es} cluster. It supports automatic routing of `aws.cloudtrail`, `aws.cloudwatch_logs`, `aws.elb_logs`, `aws.firewall_logs`, `aws.vpcflow`, and `aws.waf` logs. For other log types, if using data streams, you can optionally set its value in the configuration file according to the naming convention for data streams and available integrations. If the `es_datastream_name` is not specified and it cannot be matched with any of the above {aws} services, then the value will be set to `logs-generic-default`. In version **v0.29.1** and earlier, this configuration parameter was named `es_index_or_datastream_name`. Rename the configuration parameter to `es_datastream_name` in your `config.yaml` file on the S3 bucket to continue using it in the future version. The older name `es_index_or_datastream_name` is deprecated as of version **v0.30.0**. The related backward compatibility code is removed from version **v1.0.0**.
  * `args.batch_max_actions`: (Optional) Maximum number of actions to send in a single bulk request. Default value: 500.
  * `args.batch_max_bytes`: (Optional) Maximum size in bytes to send in a single bulk request. Default value: 10485760 (10MB).
  * `args.ssl_assert_fingerprint`: (Optional) SSL fingerprint for self-signed SSL certificate on HTTPS transport.

[[aws-serverless-forwarder-define-deploy-parameters]]
== Define `elastic-serverless-forwarder` Parameters for Deployment
In order to deploy the Elastic Serverless Forwarder for {aws} you must define some parameters, that will be used by every of the methods available for deployment.

There are four different groups of parameters.

- General Configuration: parameters related to the general configuration and the Elastic Serverless Forwarder behaviour
- Inputs: parameters related to your specific <<aws-serverless-forwarder-inputs>> (ie: event triggers)
- S3 Buckets Permissions: parameters related to the permissions required in order to access the S3 Buckets of <<aws-serverless-forwarder-inputs-s3>>
- Network: permissions related to the network environment of the Elastic Serverless Forwarder

- General Configuration:
  * `ElasticServerlessForwarderS3ConfigFile`
  * `ElasticServerlessForwarderSSMSecrets`
  * `ElasticServerlessForwarderKMSKeys`
  * `ElasticServerlessForwarderAssumeRoles`
- Event Triggers:
  * `ElasticServerlessForwarderSQSEvents`
  * `ElasticServerlessForwarderS3SQSEvents`
  * `ElasticServerlessForwarderKinesisEvents`
  * `ElasticServerlessForwarderCloudWatchLogsEvents`
- S3 Buckets Permissions:
  * `ElasticServerlessForwarderS3Buckets`
- Network:
  * `ElasticServerlessForwarderSecurityGroups`
  * `ElasticServerlessForwarderSubnets`

Parameters:

- `ElasticServerlessForwarderS3ConfigFile`: Set this value to the location of your Elastic Serverless Forwarder configuration file in S3 URL format: `s3://bucket-name/config-file-name`. This will populate the `S3_CONFIG_FILE` environment variable for the forwarder.
- `ElasticServerlessForwarderSSMSecrets`: Add a comma delimited list of {aws} SSM Secrets ARNs used in the `config.yml` (if any).
- `ElasticServerlessForwarderKMSKeys`: Add a comma delimited list of {aws} KMS Keys ARNs to be used for decrypting {aws} SSM Secrets, Kinesis Data Streams or SQS queue (if any).
- `ElasticServerlessForwarderAssumeRoles`: Add a comma delimited list of {aws} IAM Roles ARNs that the Elastic Serverless Forwarder should be given permission for `sts:AssumeRole` action. (if any).
- `ElasticServerlessForwarderSQSEvents`: Add a comma delimited list of Direct SQS queues ARNs to set as event triggers for the forwarder (if any).
- `ElasticServerlessForwarderS3SQSEvents`: Add a comma delimited list of S3 SQS Event Notifications ARNs to set as event triggers for the forwarder (if any).
- `ElasticServerlessForwarderKinesisEvents`: Add a comma delimited list of Kinesis Data Stream ARNs to set as event triggers for the forwarder (if any).
- `ElasticServerlessForwarderCloudWatchLogsEvents`: Add a comma delimited list of Cloudwatch Logs log group ARNs to set subscription filters on the forwarder (if any).

- `ElasticServerlessForwarderSecurityGroups`: Add a comma delimited list of security group IDs to attach to the Elastic Serverless Forwarder. Along with the `ElasticServerlessForwarderSubnets` this settings will define the {aws} VPC the Elastic Serverless Forwarder will belong to. Leave it empty if you don't want to    have the Elastic Serverless Forwarder belong to any specific {aws} VPC.
- `ElasticServerlessForwarderSubnets`: Add a comma delimited list of subnets IDs for to the Elastic Serverless Forwarder. Along with the `ElasticServerlessForwarderSecurityGroups` this settings will define the {aws} VPC the Elastic Serverless Forwarder will belong to. Leave it empty if you don't want to have the Elastic Serverless Forwarder belong to any specific {aws} VPC.

[NOTE]
====
Make sure you reference the ARNs specified in your `config.yaml`, and leaving any settings for unused inputs blank
====

[NOTE]
====
In case you set up an {aws} VPC for the Elastic Serverless Forwarder, please comply with the required <<aws-serverless-troubleshooting-vpc-prerequisites,prerequisites>>.

[[aws-serverless-forwarder-deploy-sar]]
== Deploy `elastic-serverless-forwarder` from Serverless Application Repository

There are several deployment methods available via the {aws} Serverless Application Repository:

* <<aws-serverless-forwarder-deploy-console>>
* <<aws-serverless-forwarder-deploy-cloudformation>>
* <<aws-serverless-forwarder-deploy-terraform>>

[[aws-serverless-forwarder-deploy-console]]
=== Deploy using {aws} Console

. Log in to {aws} console and open **Lambda**.
. Click **Applications** and then **Create application**.
. Click **Serverless application** and search for **elastic-serverless-forwarder**.
. Select **elastic-serverless-forwarder** from the search results (ignoring any application beginning *helper-*).
+
[role="screenshot"]
image::images/aws-serverless-forwarder-create-function.png[Create Elastic Serverless Forwarder Lambda function within SAR]
+
. Complete the **Application settings** as follows, making sure you reference the ARNs specified in your `config.yaml`, and leaving any settings for unused inputs blank:
    * `ElasticServerlessForwarderS3ConfigFile`: Set the value of the S3 URL in the format `s3://bucket-name/config-file-name` to the configuration file for your deployment of Elastic Serverless Forwarder. This will populate the `S3_CONFIG_FILE` environment variable of the deployed Lambda.
    * `ElasticServerlessForwarderSSMSecrets` add a comma delimited list of {aws} SSM Secrets ARNs referenced in the config yaml file (if any).
    * `ElasticServerlessForwarderKMSKeys` add a comma delimited list of {aws} KMS Keys ARNs to be used for decrypting {aws} SSM Secrets referenced in the config yaml file (if any).
    * `ElasticServerlessForwarderSQSEvents` add a comma delimited list of Direct SQS queues ARNs to set as event triggers for the Lambda (if any).
    * `ElasticServerlessForwarderS3SQSEvents` add a comma delimited list of S3 SQS Event Notifications ARNs to set as event triggers for the Lambda (if any).
    * `ElasticServerlessForwarderKinesisEvents` add a comma delimited list of Kinesis Data Stream ARNs to set as event triggers for the Lambda (if any).
    * `ElasticServerlessForwarderCloudWatchLogsEvents` add a comma delimited list of Cloudwatch Logs Log Groups ARNs to set subscription filters on the Lambda (if any).
    * `ElasticServerlessForwarderS3Buckets` add a comma delimited list of S3 buckets ARNs that are sources for the S3 SQS Event Notifications (if any).
. After your settings have been added, click **Deploy**.
. On the Applications page for **serverlessrepo-elastic-serverless-forwarder**, click **Deployments**.
. Refresh the **Deployment history** until you see the `Create complete` status update. It should take around 5 minutes to deploy &mdash; if the deployment fails for any reason, the create events will be rolled back and you will be able to see an explanation for which event failed.
. (Optional) To enable Elastic APM instrumentation for your new deployment:
    * Go to **Lambda > Functions** within {aws} console, and find and select the function with **serverlessrepo-**.
    * Go to **Configuration** tab and select **Environment Variables**
    * Add the following environment variables:

      | Key                       | Value  |
      |---------------------------|--------|
      |`ELASTIC_APM_ACTIVE`       | `true` |
      |`ELASTIC_APM_SECRET_TOKEN` | token  |
      |`ELASTIC_APM_SERVER_URL`	  | url    |

NOTE: If you have already successfully deployed the forwarder but want to update the application (for example, if a new version of the Lambda function is released), you should go through this deploy step again and use the same **Application name**. This will ensure the function is updated rather than duplicated or created anew.

:keywords: serverless
:description: Publish the Elastic Serverless Forwarder with maximum level of customisation.

In case the customisation available by <<aws-serverless-forwarder-deploy-sar>> are not enough for your case, since version `1.6.0`, it is possible to publish the Elastic Serverless Forwarder directly in your {aws} Account without relying on {aws} Serverless Application Repository (SAR).


If you chose this option, you have to:

* <<aws-serverless-forwarder-deploy-kibana>>
* <<sample-s3-config-file>>
* <<sample-direct-publish-config-file>>
* <<aws-serverless-forwarder-run-publish-script>>

[[sample-direct-publish-config-file]]
=== Create `publish-config.yaml` for the publishing script

Publishing Elastic Serverless Forwarder directly requires a `publish-config.yaml` file to be passed as argument in order to <<aws-serverless-forwarder-run-publish-script>>.

Save the following YAML content as `publish-config.yaml` and edit as required before running the publishing script. You should remove any inputs or arguments you are not using.

[[aws-serverless-forwarder-run-publish-script]]
== Run the publishing script

In the root of the https://github.com/elastic/elastic-serverless-forwarder[Elastic Serverless Forwarder repository]  is available a bash script for publishing directly the Elastic Serveless Forwarder on your {aws} Account.

The name of the script is `publish_lambda.sh`. The script is self-contained: you don't need to clone the full repository in order to run it. Downloading the https://raw.githubusercontent.com/elastic/elastic-serverless-forwarder/lambda-v1.6.0/publish_lambda.sh[raw content of the file] from GitHub is enough.

=== Publishing script arguments
[source, bash]
----

 $ ./publish_lambda.sh
    AWS CLI (https://aws.amazon.com/cli/), SAM (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/install-sam-cli.html) and Python3.9 with pip3 required
    Please, before launching the tool execute "$ pip3 install ruamel.yaml"
Usage: ./publish_lambda.sh config-path lambda-name forwarder-tag bucket-name region
    Arguments:
    config-path: full path to the publish configuration
    lambda-name: name of the lambda to be published in the account
    forwarder-tag: tag of the elastic serverless forwarder to publish
    bucket-name: bucket name where to store the zip artifact for the lambda
                 (it will be created if it doesn't exists, otherwise
                  you need already to have proper access to it)
    region: region where to publish in
----

=== Prerequisites
Python3.9 with pip3 is a prerequirement for the script.
https://aws.amazon.com/cli/[{aws} CLI], https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/install-sam-cli.html[SAM CLI] and the https://pypi.org/project/ruamel.yaml/[ruamel.yaml package] must be installed as well:

[source, bash]
----

$ pip3 install awscli aws-sam-cli ruamel.yaml

----

=== Running the script
Assuming you have saved `publish-config.yaml` in the directory you run `publish_lambda.sh` from, here's an example for running the script:

[source, bash]
----

$ ./publish_lambda.sh ./publish-config.yaml first-lambda lambda-v1.5.0 s3-bucket-name eu-central-1

----

=== Updating the Elastic Serverless Forwarder to a new version
In order to update the version of an already published Elastic Serverless Forwarder, without changing its configuration, you can just run the publishing script again passing a new https://github.com/elastic/elastic-serverless-forwarder/tags[`forwarder-tag`] argument:

[source, bash]
----

$ ./publish_lambda.sh ./publish-config.yaml first-lambda lambda-v1.6.0 s3-bucket-name eu-central-1

----

=== Changing the Elastic Serverless Forwarder configuration
In case you want to change the configuration of an already published Elastic Serverless Forwarder, without changing its version, you should update the `publish-config.yaml` as desired and run again the script using the same `forwarder-tag` currently published:

[source, bash]
----

$ ./publish_lambda.sh ./publish-config.yaml first-lambda lambda-v1.5.0 s3-bucket-name eu-central-1

----

=== Publishing Elastic Serverless Forwarder multiple times
If you want to publish multiple times the Elastic Serverless Forwarder, with different configurations each, you should create two different `publish-config.yaml` with unique names and run the publishing script two times referring the proper values for `config-path` and `lambda-name` arguments:

[source, bash]
----

$ ./publish_lambda.sh ./publish-config-for-first-lambda.yaml first-lambda lambda-v1.5.0 s3-bucket-name eu-central-1

$ ./publish_lambda.sh ./publish-config-for-second-lambda.yaml second-lambda lambda-v1.5.0 s3-bucket-name eu-central-1

----
