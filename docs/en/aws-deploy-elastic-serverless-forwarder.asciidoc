:description: Deploy the Elastic Serverless Forwarder using Kibana and the AWS Serverless Application Repository (SAR).

To deploy Elastic Serverless Forwarder, you have to:

* <<aws-serverless-forwarder-deploy-kibana>>
* <<sample-s3-config-file>>
* <<aws-serverless-forwarder-define-deploy-parameters>>
* <<aws-serverless-forwarder-deploy-sar>>

[[aws-serverless-forwarder-deploy-prereq]]
== Prerequisites
This documentation assumes you have some familiarity with {aws} services, and you have correctly created and configured the necessary {aws} objects.
// Need more details on pre-reqs for other input types

NOTE: This page describes the basic steps required to deploy Elastic Serverless
Forwarder for {aws}— for additional information on configuration topics such as permissions and automatic routing, and parsing and enriching data, see <<aws-elastic-serverless-forwarder-configuration>>.

[[aws-serverless-forwarder-deploy-direct-note]]
== Deploying directly without SAR
If the customization options available when deploying via Serverless Application Repository (SAR) are not sufficient, from version `1.6.0` and above you can <<aws-serverless-forwarder-direct-deploy,deploy the Elastic Serverless Forwarder directly>> to your {aws} Account without using SAR. This enables you to customize the event source settings for the inputs (i.e. triggers) one-by-one.

[[aws-serverless-forwarder-deploy-kibana]]
== Install {aws} integration assets in {kib}

. Go to **Integrations** in {kib} and search for {aws} (or select the **{aws}**
  category to filter the list).
. Click the {aws} integration, select **Settings** and click
**Install {aws} assets** and confirm to install all the {aws} integration assets.

[role="screenshot"]
image::images/aws-serverless-forwarder-install-assets.png[Find and install AWS integration assets in {kib}]

Adding integrations from {kib} provides appropriate pre-built dashboards,
ingest node configurations, and other assets that help you get the most out of
the data you ingest. The integrations use https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/data-streams.html[data streams]
with specific https://www.elastic.co/blog/an-introduction-to-the-elastic-data-stream-naming-scheme[naming conventions]
that provide you with more granular controls and flexibility on managing data ingestion.

NOTE: We recommend using integration assets to get started but the forwarder supports writing to any index, alias, or custom data stream. This enables existing Elasticsearch users to re-use index templates, ingest pipelines, or dashboards that are already created and connected to existing processes or systems. If you already have an existing index or data stream you intend to send data to, then you can skip this deployment step.

[[sample-s3-config-file]]
== Create and upload `config.yaml` to S3 bucket

Elastic Serverless Forwarder requires a `config.yaml` file to be uploaded to an S3 bucket and referenced by the `S3_CONFIG_FILE` environment variable.

Save the following YAML content as `config.yaml` and edit as required before uploading to an S3 bucket. You should remove any inputs or arguments you are not using, and ensure you have entered the correct URLs and credentials as per the inline comments.

WARNING: All versions up to 1.14.0 (included) only allow one output per type. So if the `output.type` chosen by a user is `elasticsearch`, then the user can only configure one output for it.

[discrete]
[[s3-config-file-fields]]
=== Fields

//convert to description list?

`inputs.[]`:

A list of inputs (i.e. triggers) for the Elastic Serverless Forwarder Lambda function.

`inputs.[].type`:

The type of trigger input (`cloudwatch-logs`, `kinesis-data-stream`, `sqs` and `s3-sqs` are currently supported).

`inputs.[].id`:

The ARN of the trigger input according to the type. Multiple input entries can have different unique ids with the same type.
Inputs of type `cloudwatch-logs` accept both CloudWatch Logs Log Group and CloudWatch Logs Log Stream ARNs.

`inputs.[].outputs`:

A list of outputs (i.e. forwarding targets) for the Elastic Serverless Forwarder Lambda function. You can have multiple outputs for an input, but only one output can be defined per type.

`inputs.[].outputs.[].type`:

The type of the forwarding target output. Currently only the following outputs are supported:

 * `elasticsearch`
 * preview:[] `logstash`

Each type can only be used for a maximum of one output up to and including 1.14.0 version. If {ls} is chosen as an output, Elastic Serverless Forwarder expects the {logstash-ref}/plugins-inputs-elastic_serverless_forwarder.html[`elastic_serverless_forwarder`] Logstash input to be installed, enabled, and properly configured. For more information about installing Logstash plugins, refer to the {logstash-ref}/working-with-plugins.html#installing-plugins[Logstash documentation].

`inputs.[].outputs.[].args`:
Custom init arguments for the specified forwarding target output.

For `elasticsearch` the following arguments are supported:

  * `args.elasticsearch_url`: URL of elasticsearch endpoint in the format `http(s)://domain.tld:port`. Mandatory when `args.cloud_id` is not provided. Will take precedence over `args.cloud_id` if both are defined.
  * `args.cloud_id`: Cloud ID of elasticsearch endpoint. Mandatory when `args.elasticsearch_url` is not provided. Will be ignored if `args.elasticsearch_url` is defined.
  * `args.username`: Username of the elasticsearch instance to connect to. Mandatory when `args.api_key` is not provided. Will take precedence over `args.api_key` if both are defined.
  * `args.password` Password of the elasticsearch instance to connect to. Mandatory when `args.api_key` is not provided. Will take precedence over `args.api_key` if both are defined.
  * `args.api_key`:  API key of elasticsearch endpoint in the format `base64encode(api_key_id:api_key_secret)`. Mandatory when `args.username`  and `args.password` are not provided. Will be ignored if `args.username`/`args.password` are defined.
  * `args.es_datastream_name`: Name of data stream or index where logs should be forwarded to. Lambda supports automatic routing of various {aws} service logs to the corresponding data streams for further processing and storage in the {es} cluster. It supports automatic routing of `aws.cloudtrail`, `aws.cloudwatch_logs`, `aws.elb_logs`, `aws.firewall_logs`, `aws.vpcflow`, and `aws.waf` logs. For other log types, if using data streams, you can optionally set its value in the configuration file according to the naming convention for data streams and available integrations. If the `es_datastream_name` is not specified and it cannot be matched with any of the above {aws} services, then the value will be set to `logs-generic-default`. In versions **v0.29.1** and below, this configuration parameter was named `es_index_or_datastream_name`. Rename the configuration parameter to `es_datastream_name` in your `config.yaml` file on the S3 bucket to continue using it in the future version. The older name `es_index_or_datastream_name` is deprecated as of version **v0.30.0**. The related backward compatibility code is removed from version **v1.0.0**.
  * `args.es_dead_letter_index`: Name of data stream or index where logs should be redirected to, in case indexing to `args.es_datastream_name` returned an error.
  * `args.batch_max_actions`: (Optional) Maximum number of actions to send in a single bulk request. Default value: 500.
  * `args.batch_max_bytes`: (Optional) Maximum size in bytes to send in a single bulk request. Default value: 10485760 (10MB).
  * `args.ssl_assert_fingerprint`: (Optional) SSL fingerprint for self-signed SSL certificate on HTTPS transport. The default value is an empty string, meaning the HTTP client requires a valid certificate.

For `logstash` the following arguments are supported:

  * `args.logstash_url`: URL of {ls} endpoint in the format `http(s)://host:port`
  * `args.username`: (Optional) Username of the {ls} instance to connect to. Mandatory if HTTP Basic authentication is enabled in {ls}.
  * `args.password`: (Optional) Password of the {ls} instance to connect to. Mandatory if HTTP Basic authentication is enabled in {ls}.
  * `args.max_batch_size`: (Optional) Maximum number of events to send in a single HTTP(s) request. Default value: 500
  * `args.compression_level`: (Optional) The GZIP compression level for HTTP(s) requests towards {ls}. It can be any integer value between 1 (minimum compression, best performance, highest amount of bytes sent) and 9 (maximum compression, worst performance, lowest amount of bytes sent). Default value: 1
  * `args.ssl_assert_fingerprint`: (Optional) SSL fingerprint for self-signed SSL certificate on HTTPS transport. The default value is an empty string, meaning the HTTP client requires a valid certificate.

[[aws-serverless-forwarder-define-deploy-parameters]]
== Define deployment parameters
Whichever SAR deployment method you choose, you must define the following parameters correctly for your setup. This section explains the types of parameters and provides guidance on how to set them to match your deployment(s).

[discrete]
=== General configuration
These parameters define the general configuration and behaviour for the forwarder.

- `ElasticServerlessForwarderS3ConfigFile`: Set this value to the location of your `config.yaml` in S3 URL format: `s3://bucket-name/config-file-name`. This will populate the `S3_CONFIG_FILE` environment variable for the forwarder.
- `ElasticServerlessForwarderSSMSecrets`: Add a comma delimited list of {aws} SSM Secrets ARNs used in the `config.yml` (if any).
- `ElasticServerlessForwarderKMSKeys`: Add a comma delimited list of {aws} KMS Keys ARNs to be used for decrypting {aws} SSM Secrets, Kinesis Data Streams, SQS queue, or S3 buckets (if any).

[NOTE]
====
Make sure you include all the KMS keys used to encrypt the data. For example, S3 buckets are often encrypted, so the Lambda function needs access to that key to get the object.
====

[discrete]
=== Inputs
These parameters define your specific <<aws-serverless-forwarder-inputs>> or 'event triggers'.

- `ElasticServerlessForwarderSQSEvents`: Add a comma delimited list of Direct SQS queue ARNs to set as event triggers for the forwarder (if any).
- `ElasticServerlessForwarderSQSEvents2`: Add a comma delimited list of Direct SQS queue ARNs to set as event triggers for the forwarder (if limit is reach on ElasticServerlessForwarderSQSEvents).
- `ElasticServerlessForwarderS3SQSEvents`: Add a comma delimited list of S3 SQS Event Notifications ARNs to set as event triggers for the forwarder (if any).
- `ElasticServerlessForwarderS3SQSEvents2`: Add a comma delimited list of S3 SQS Event Notifications ARNs to set as event triggers for the forwarder (if limit is reach on ElasticServerlessForwarderS3SQSEvents).
- `ElasticServerlessForwarderKinesisEvents`: Add a comma delimited list of Kinesis Data Stream ARNs to set as event triggers for the forwarder (if any).
- `ElasticServerlessForwarderKinesisEvents2`: Add a comma delimited list of Kinesis Data Stream ARNs to set as event triggers for the forwarder (if limit is reach on ElasticServerlessForwarderKinesisEvents).
- `ElasticServerlessForwarderCloudWatchLogsEvents`: Add a comma delimited list of Cloudwatch Logs log group ARNs to set subscription filters on the forwarder (if any).
- `ElasticServerlessForwarderCloudWatchLogsEvents2`: Add a comma delimited list of Cloudwatch Logs log group ARNs to set subscription filters on the forwarder (if limit is reach on ElasticServerlessForwarderCloudWatchLogsEvents).

[NOTE]
====
Make sure you reference the ARNs specified in your `config.yaml`, and leave any settings for unused inputs blank.
====

[discrete]
=== S3 Bucket permissions
These parameters define the permissions required in order to access the associated S3 Buckets.

- `ElasticServerlessForwarderS3Buckets`: Add a comma delimited list of S3 bucket ARNs that are sources for the S3 SQS Event Notifications (if any).

[discrete]
=== Network

To attach the Elastic Serverless Forwarder to a specific {aws} VPC, specify the security group IDs and subnet IDs that belong to the {aws} VPC. This requirement is related to the https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-properties-lambda-function-vpcconfig.html[CloudFormation VPCConfig property].

These are the parameters:

- `ElasticServerlessForwarderSecurityGroups`: Add a comma delimited list of security group IDs to attach to the forwarder.
- `ElasticServerlessForwarderSubnets`: Add a comma delimited list of subnet IDs for the forwarder.

Both parameters are required in order to attach the Elastic Serverless Forwarder to a specific {aws} VPC.
Leave both parameters blank if you don't want the forwarder to belong to any specific {aws} VPC.

If the Elastic Serverless Forwarder is attached to a VPC, you need to https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/privatelink/create-interface-endpoint.html[create VPC endpoints] for S3 and SQS, and for *every* service you define as an input for the forwarder. S3 and SQS VPC endpoints are always required for reading the `config.yaml` uploaded to S3 and managing the continuing queue and the replay queue, regardless of the <<aws-serverless-forwarder-inputs>> used. If you use <<aws-serverless-forwarder-inputs-cloudwatch>>, you need to create a VPC endpoint for EC2, too.

NOTE: Refer to the {cloud}/ec-traffic-filtering-vpc.html[AWS PrivateLink traffic filters] documentation to find your VPC endpoint ID and the hostname to use in the `config.yml` in order to access your Elasticsearch cluster over PrivateLink.

[discrete]
[[aws-serverless-forwarder-deploy-terraform]]
== Deploy Elastic Serverless Forwarder from Terraform

The terraform files to deploy ESF can be found in https://github.com/elastic/terraform-elastic-esf[`esf-terraform` repository]. There are two requirements to deploy these files: https://curl.se/download.html[curl] and https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/aws-get-started/install-cli[terraform]. Refer to the https://github.com/elastic/terraform-elastic-esf/blob/main/README.md[README file] to learn how to use it.


[discrete]
[[aws-serverless-forwarder-deploy-sar]]
== Deploy Elastic Serverless Forwarder from SAR

There are several deployment methods available via the {aws} Serverless Application Repository (SAR):

* <<aws-serverless-forwarder-deploy-console>>
* <<aws-serverless-forwarder-deploy-cloudformation>>
* <<aws-serverless-forwarder-deploy-sar-terraform>>

NOTE: To deploy the forwarder directly without using SAR, refer to <<aws-serverless-forwarder-direct-deploy>>

[discrete]
[[aws-serverless-forwarder-deploy-console]]
=== Deploy using {aws} Console

. Log in to {aws} console and open **Lambda**.
. Click **Applications** and then **Create application**.
. Click **Serverless application** and search for **elastic-serverless-forwarder**.
. Select **elastic-serverless-forwarder** from the search results (ignoring any application beginning *helper-*).
+
[role="screenshot"]
image::images/aws-serverless-forwarder-create-function.png[Create Elastic Serverless Forwarder Lambda function within SAR]
+
. Complete the **Application settings** according to <<aws-serverless-forwarder-define-deploy-parameters>>.
. After your settings have been added, click **Deploy**.
. On the Applications page for **serverlessrepo-elastic-serverless-forwarder**, click **Deployments**.
. Refresh the **Deployment history** until you see the `Create complete` status update. It should take around 5 minutes to deploy &mdash; if the deployment fails for any reason, the create events will be rolled back and you will be able to see an explanation for which event failed.
. (Optional) To enable Elastic APM instrumentation for your new deployment:
    * Go to **Lambda > Functions** within {aws} console, and find and select the function with **serverlessrepo-**.
    * Go to **Configuration** tab and select **Environment Variables**
    * Add the following environment variables:

      | Key                       | Value  |
      |---------------------------|--------|
      |`ELASTIC_APM_ACTIVE`       | `true` |
      |`ELASTIC_APM_SECRET_TOKEN` | token  |
      |`ELASTIC_APM_SERVER_URL`	  | url    |

NOTE: If you have already successfully deployed the forwarder but want to update the application (for example, if a new version of the Lambda function is released), you should go through this deploy step again and use the same **Application name**. This will ensure the function is updated rather than duplicated or created anew.

[discrete]
[[aws-serverless-forwarder-deploy-cloudformation]]
=== Deploy using Cloudformation

. Use the following code to get the semantic version of the latest application:

[NOTE]
====
From **v1.4.0** and above, if you want to update the Events settings for the deployment, it is no longer required to manually delete existing settings before applying the new settings.

Due to a https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-aws/issues/24771[Terraform bug] related to `aws_serverlessapplicationrepository_application`, if you want to delete existing Event parameters you have to set the related `aws_serverlessapplicationrepository_cloudformation_stack.parameters` to a blank space value (`" "`) instead of an empty string (`""`).

[[aws-serverless-forwarder-direct-deploy]]
== Deploy Elastic Serverless Forwarder directly

For more customisation options during deployment, from version `1.6.0` and above you can deploy the Elastic Serverless Forwarder directly to your {aws} Account without using SAR. This enables you to customize the event source settings for the inputs (i.e. triggers) one-by-one.

To deploy the forwarder directly, you have to:

* <<aws-serverless-forwarder-deploy-kibana>>
* <<sample-s3-config-file>>
* <<sample-direct-publish-config-file>>
* <<aws-serverless-forwarder-run-publish-script>>

[discrete]
[[sample-direct-publish-config-file]]
=== Create `publish-config.yaml` for the publishing script

To deploy the forwarder directly, you need to define a `publish-config.yaml` file and pass this as an argument in the <<aws-serverless-forwarder-run-publish-script, publishing script>>.

Save the following YAML content as `publish-config.yaml` and edit as required before running the publishing script. You should remove any inputs or arguments you are not using.

[[aws-serverless-forwarder-run-publish-script]]
=== Run the publishing script

A bash script for publishing the Elastic Serverless Forwarder directly to your {aws} account is available from the https://github.com/elastic/elastic-serverless-forwarder[Elastic Serverless Forwarder repository].

Download the https://raw.githubusercontent.com/elastic/elastic-serverless-forwarder/lambda-v1.8.0/publish_lambda.sh[`publish_lambda.sh` script] and follow the instructions below.

[discrete]
==== Script arguments

[source, bash]
----

 $ ./publish_lambda.sh
    AWS CLI (https://aws.amazon.com/cli/), SAM (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/install-sam-cli.html) and Python3.9 with pip3 required
    Please, before launching the tool execute "$ pip3 install ruamel.yaml"
Usage: ./publish_lambda.sh config-path lambda-name forwarder-tag bucket-name region [custom-role-prefix]
    Arguments:
    config-path: full path to the publish configuration
    lambda-name: name of the lambda to be published in the account
    forwarder-tag: tag of the elastic serverless forwarder to publish
    bucket-name: bucket name where to store the zip artifact for the lambda
                 (it will be created if it doesn't exists, otherwise
                  you need already to have proper access to it)
    region: region where to publish in
    custom-role-prefix: role/policy prefix to add in case customization is needed (optional)
                        (please note that the prefix will be added to both role/policy naming)
----

[discrete]
==== Prerequisites

- Python3.9 with pip3 is required to run the script
- https://aws.amazon.com/cli/[{aws} CLI], https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/install-sam-cli.html[SAM CLI] and the https://pypi.org/project/ruamel.yaml/[ruamel.yaml package] must also be installed

[source, bash]
----

$ pip3 install awscli aws-sam-cli ruamel.yaml

----

[discrete]
==== Running the script
Assuming `publish-config.yaml` in saved in the same directory you intend to run `publish_lambda.sh` from, here's an example:

[source, bash]
----

$ ./publish_lambda.sh publish-config.yaml forwarder-lambda lambda-v1.6.0 s3-lambda-artifact-bucket-name eu-central-1

----

[discrete]
==== Updating to a new version via script
You can update the version of a published Elastic Serverless Forwarder without changing its configuration by running the publishing script again and passing a *new* https://github.com/elastic/elastic-serverless-forwarder/tags[`forwarder-tag`]:

[source, bash]
----

$ ./publish_lambda.sh publish-config.yaml forwarder-lambda lambda-v1.7.0 s3-lambda-artifact-bucket-name eu-central-1

----

NOTE: The above examples show the forwarder being updated from `lambda-v1.6.0` to `lambda-v1.7.0`.

[discrete]
==== Changing configuration via script
If you want to change the configuration of a published Elastic Serverless Forwarder without changing its version, you can update the `publish-config.yaml` and run the script again using the *same* `forwarder-tag`:

[source, bash]
----

$ ./publish_lambda.sh publish-config.yaml forwarder-lambda lambda-v1.6.0 s3-lambda-artifact-bucket-name eu-central-1

----

NOTE: The above example shows an existing `lambda-v1.6.0` configuration being updated without changing version.

[discrete]
==== Using the script for multiple deployments
If you want to use the publish script for deploying the forwarder with different configurations, create two different `publish-config.yaml` files with unique names and run the publishing script twice, with correct references to the `config-path` and `lambda-name`:

[source, bash]
----

$ ./publish_lambda.sh publish-config-for-first-lambda.yaml first-lambda lambda-v1.6.0 s3-lambda-artifact-bucket-name eu-central-1

$ ./publish_lambda.sh publish-config-for-second-lambda.yaml second-lambda lambda-v1.6.0 ss3-lambda-artifact-bucket-name eu-central-1

----

NOTE: The above example publishes two versions of the forwarder, each with different configurations i.e. `publish-config-for-first-lambda.yaml` and `first-lambda` vs. `publish-config-for-second-lambda.yaml` and `second-lambda`.
