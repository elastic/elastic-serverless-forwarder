# Introduction

The Elastic Serverless Forwarder is an Amazon Web Services (AWS) Lambda function that ships logs from an AWS environment to Elastic.

Please refer to the official [Elastic documentation for Elastic Serverless Forwarder](https://www.elastic.co/docs/reference/aws-forwarder) for detailed instructions on how to deploy and configure the forwarder.

## Overview

- Amazon S3 (via SQS event notifications)

## Important - v1.6.0

#### Version 1.6.0 introduces a new event ID format which is backwards incompatible with previously indexed events. Be aware that previously indexed events would be duplicated if they trigger the forwarder again after upgrading to this version. More information is available at [our troubleshooting documentation](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/observability/master/aws-serverless-troubleshooting.html#aws-serverless-troubleshooting-event-id-format).
